Installer packages are currently not provided. However, you can manually "install" to your system with a few commands. Updates are just easy to manage and don't require much effort.

### Target OS
- Debian 11, Ubuntu 20.04 and later. Earlier versions are untested.
- Arch, Manjaro.

Note: The default web server user is `www-data` on Debian and `http` on Arch. Please adjust the `nginx.conf` file accordingly if you do not use the default web server user.

[NGINX Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/guide/) is available for those seeking containers or have little know-how. I do not know if this version of NGINX supports HTTP/3 + QUIC.

This build is intended for my personal use. I prefer to write manual vhost/conf files or need the software to run on bare metal. If you fit this, feel free to use it.

# First Time Use
1. Download the latest zip from releases to the root (`/`) of your system while elevated as the `root` user.
    ```
    wget https://github.com/icedterminal/ngxqb/releases/latest/download/nginx-arch.zip
    wget https://github.com/icedterminal/ngxqb/releases/latest/download/nginx-debian.zip
    ```
3. Extract the contents
    ```bash
    unzip -o nginx-*.zip
    ```
4. Set the permissions
    ```bash
    chown [www-data|http]:adm /var/log/nginx; chmod 755 /var/log/nginx; find /var/cache/nginx -type d | xargs chown [www-data|http]:root; find /var/cache/nginx -type d | xargs chmod 755
    ```
5. Load the service (If you do not specify a user in `nginx.conf`, the default user will be used).
    ```bash
    systemctl daemon-reload; systemctl enable nginx
    ```
6. Start the service
    ```
    systemctl start nginx
    ```

Visit [`http://localhost:80`](http://localhost:80) or [`http://127.0.0.1:80`](http://127.0.0.1:80). The default `nginx.conf` file uses the build prefix path of `/etc/nginx`. You should only store configuration files here. Not web files. The default html files are placed here so you can verify you have a working service. You are encouraged to use `/var/www/html` as your root for web files. You can delete the zip file if you like as there is no need to keep it.

You can check your NGINX build information with `nginx -V`.

# Updates

    ```
3. Stop the service, Extract updated binary, start the service
    ```bash
    systemctl stop nginx; unzip -oj nginx-*.zip "sbin/nginx" -d /sbin/; systemctl start nginx
    ```

You can check your NGINX build information with `nginx -V`.
