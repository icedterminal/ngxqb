Installer packages are currently not provided. However, you can manually "install" to your system with a few commands. Updates are just easy to manage and don't require much effort.

The target OS is Ubuntu 20.04 or Debian 11 and later. Earlier versions are untested. No builds or instructions for containers or other distributions will be provided. I have no interest. [NGINX Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/guide/) is available for those seeking containers or have little know-how. I do not know if this version of NGINX supports HTTP/3 + QUIC. This build is intended for my personal use. I prefer to write manual vhost/conf files or need the software to run on bare metal. If you fit this, feel free to use it.

# First Time Use
1. Download the [latest zip from releases](https://github.com/icedterminal/ngxqb/releases/latest/download/ngxqb.zip) to the root (`/`) of your system while elevated as the `root` user.
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/icedterminal/ngxqb/releases/latest/download/ngxqb.zip
    ```
3. Extract the contents
    ```bash
    unzip -o ngxqb.zip
    ```
4. Set the permissions
    ```bash
    chown www-data:adm /var/log/nginx; chmod 755 /var/log/nginx; find /var/cache/nginx -type d | xargs chown www-data:root; find /var/cache/nginx -type d | xargs chmod 755
    ```
5. Start the service
    ```bash
    systemctl daemon-reload; systemctl enable nginx; systemctl start nginx
    ```

Visit [`http://localhost:80`](http://localhost:80) or [`http://127.0.0.1:80`](http://127.0.0.1:80). The default `nginx.conf` file uses the build prefix path of `/etc/nginx`. You should only store configuration files here. Not web files. The default html files are placed here so you can verify you have a working service. You are encouraged to use `/var/www/html` as your root for web files. You can delete the zip file if you like as there is no need to keep it.

You can check your NGINX build information with `nginx -V`.

# Updates
1. Download the latest zip from releases to the root (`/`) of your system while elevated as the `root` user.
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/icedterminal/ngxqb/releases/latest/download/ngxqb.zip
    ```
3. Stop the service, extract only the updated binary, start the service
    ```bash
    systemctl stop nginx; unzip -oj ngxqb.zip "sbin/nginx" -d /sbin/; systemctl start nginx
    ```

You can check your NGINX build information with `nginx -V`.
