Installer packages are currently not provided. You can manually "install" to your system with a few commands.

# First Time Use
1. Download the latest zip from releases to the root (`/`) of your system while elevated as the `root` user.
    ```
    wget https://github.com/icedterminal/ngxqb/releases/latest/download/ngxqb.zip
    ```
3. Extract the contents
    ```bash
    unzip -o ngxqb.zip
    ```
4. Set the permissions
    ```bash
    chown www-data:adm /var/log/nginx; chmod 755 /var/log/nginx; find /var/cache/nginx -type d | xargs chown www-data:root; find /var/cache/nginx -type d | xargs chmod 755
    ```
5. Start the service
    ```bash
    systemctl daemon-reload; systemctl enable nginx; systemctl start nginx
    ```

Visit [`http://localhost:80`](http://localhost:80) or [`http://127.0.0.1:80`](http://127.0.0.1:80). The default `nginx.conf` file uses the build prefix path of `/etc/nginx`. You should store configuration files here. Not web files. The default html files are placed here so you can verify you have a working service. You are encouraged to use `/var/www/html` as your root for web files. You can delete the zip file if you like as there is no need to keep it.

You can check your NGINX build information with `nginx -V`.

# Updates
1. Download the latest zip from releases to the root (`/`) of your system while elevated as the `root` user.
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/icedterminal/ngxqb/releases/latest/download/ngxqb.zip
    ```
3. Stop the service, Extract updated binary, start the service
    ```bash
    systemctl stop nginx; unzip -oj ngxqb.zip "sbin/nginx" -d /sbin/; systemctl start nginx
    ```
