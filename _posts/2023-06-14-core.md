The pieces of the puzzle. Everything used to build this software.

- [NGINX](https://hg.nginx.org/nginx) | This is the core of it all. Contains support for HTTP/3 and QUIC connections.
- [OpenSSL](https://github.com/quictls/openssl) | Alternatively called "quictls", this fork is based on the latest OpenSSL with QUIC implimentations. Requried for this build of NGINX.
- [PCRE2](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/releases/) | Enables regular expression support for NGINX.
- [Zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib) | Standard compression method.
- [Brotli](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli) | An improved compression method over GZip (zlib). [All major browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=Brotli) currently support Brotli. There is little need for GZip, however, the latest version is included for priority over system installed zlib package.
- [Dev kit](https://github.com/vision5/ngx_devel_kit) | Extends NGINX functionality. Required by Set Misc.
- [Set Misc](https://github.com/openresty/set-misc-nginx-module) | Enables the use of `set_xxx` directives. These are required for services like [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/integration/proxies/nginx/).
- [NGINX JS](https://hg.nginx.org/njs/) | Enables the use of [server-side JavaScript](https://www.nginx.com/blog/harnessing-power-convenience-of-javascript-for-each-request-with-nginx-javascript-module/).
